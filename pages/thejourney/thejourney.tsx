        On the 30th of June 2021, the partnership between Rajamangala University of Technology Lanna Nan (RMUTL) and 
        Bespoke Life Science Limited (“Bespoke”) received FDA approval for the import of 41 seed strains of cannabis of 
        up to 398 seeds and for the cultivation of cannabis for research and development (R&D). The partnership has imported 
        380 seeds representing 39 strains, giving the partnership the largest high grade foreign cannabis seed bank in terms 
        of strains in Thailand.

        Having recently received FDA approval in conjunction with its RMUTL for the legal medical production and cultivation of cannabis 
        for traditional Thai medicine purposes, Bespoke aims to harness the unique opportunity to provide an unrivalled journey 
        and experience for CannaThai420 community members.
